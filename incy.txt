Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again


A million stars up in the sky
one shines brighter I can't deny
A love so precious a love so true
a love that comes from me to you
