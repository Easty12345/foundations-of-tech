Itsy Bitsy Spider climed up the water spout...
Down came the rain and washed the spider out...
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain...
Then Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the spout again...Raaaah

Spiders are awful

Spiders are gross

Spiders are jokes guys, all about tranchulars, if thats a correct spelling for it!
