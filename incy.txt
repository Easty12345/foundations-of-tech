Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
Incy Wincy Spider drowned

Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout

A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of communism.


Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
Then the spider said:
u wan sum? I'll give it ya


Incy died

Tabby is the best



Incy died of communism
