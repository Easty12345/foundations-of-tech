Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water shouting the odds,
Down came the pain and smashed the spider out,
The spider was hurt from being drowned in all of the rain,

Then Incy Wincy Spider  up the spout again and again and AGAIN!!


Doctor Foster poem

Doctor Foster
Went to Gloucester
In a shower of rain. 
He stepped in a puddle
Right up to his middle
And never went there again!
