Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the hairdryer and dried up all the water
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again


Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the water spout
Down came the rain and spat the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the spout again

The Incy Wincy Spider, crippled by repetitive strain injuries resulting from the constant flushing, eventually succumbed
to the heavy water flow. He leaves behind a wife and a large brood of depressed spiderlings


The spider decided to take a nice little hoiday. Lovely jubly.Juliet is helpful!
