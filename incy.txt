Incy Wincy Spider crawled up the spout of the drain
Suddenly he was pushed down by all of the rain
The spider was hurt from being drowned in all of the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider never crawled up the spout again

A-men

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.
