Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the water spout
Down came the rain and spat the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the spout again



The Incy Wincy Spider, crippled by repetitive strain injuries resulting from the constant flushing, eventually succumbed
to the heavy water flow. He leaves behind a wife and a large brood of depressed spiderlings


The spider decided to take a nice little hoiday. Lovely jubly.Juliet is helpful!
