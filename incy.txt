Incy Wincy Spider crawled up the spout of the drain
Suddenly he was pushed down by all of the rain
The spider was hurt from being drowned in all of the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider never crawled up the spout again

<<<<<<< HEAD
Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
<<<<<<< HEAD


A million stars up in the sky
one shines brighter I can't deny
A love so precious a love so true
a love that comes from me to you

A-men

The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout.
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
