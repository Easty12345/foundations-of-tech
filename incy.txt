Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water shouting the odds 
Down came the pain and smashed the spider out 
Pout came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider  up the spout again and again and AGAIN!!

Incy Wincy Spider crawled up the spout of the drain
Suddenly he was pushed down by all of the rain
The spider was hurt from being drowned in all of the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider never crawled up the spout again

 OLD LADY POEM
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,
She had so many children she didn't know what to do!
So she gave them some broth without any bread,
And she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed!

Doctor Foster poem

Doctor Foster
Went to Gloucester
In a shower of rain. 
He stepped in a puddle
Right up to his middle
And never went there again!

When I'm still in love with you?
You walked away,
'Cause you didn't want to stay.
