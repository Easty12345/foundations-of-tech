Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water shouting the odds 
Down came the pain and smashed the spider out 
The spider was hurt from being drowned in all of the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider  up the spout again and again and AGAIN!!

A-men

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.
