Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water shouting the odds 
Down came the pain and smashed the spider out 
Pout came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider never crawled up the spout again
Zac missed the spider and was feeling very glum
But couldn't climb the drain coz he'd broken his thumb

A million stars up in the sky
one shines brighter I can't deny
A love so precious a love so true
a love that comes from me to you

A-men

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again.

Doctor Foster poem

Doctor Foster
Went to Gloucester
In a shower of rain. 
He stepped in a puddle
Right up to his middle
And never went there again!
