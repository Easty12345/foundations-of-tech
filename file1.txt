Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout,
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain,
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again.

Thereafter, Incy Wincy Spider continued to repeat this until he died.
There should be a moral to this story, but he passed before he could relay it to anyone.
I like to think it goes a little something like this:
"When you climb up water spouts, always check the forcast.
It's awfully embarrasing being washed out ifront of your friends."
